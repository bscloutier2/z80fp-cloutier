Z80 Floating Point Package with Calculator Routines c1990

I wrote this floating point package in the early 90's in order to create a calculator 
feature for one of my products. I pulled the source from archives. It is pretty much as 
it was. Note that I wrote the assembler and so there may be some syntatic issues with
your assembler. We also were using the Hitachi HD64180. I do not know off-hand if
there are any of those instructions in this.

Let me know what you think!
